Starting this project as I am student learning Embedded Systems. This could be a great place to keep record of all the programs what was taught in College. And it could also be helpful for the whole community out there.

Special thanks to my teachers. :-)

Feel free to experiment with the microcontroller, ask questions and discuss ideas in the discussion board.
